# wp-engine-custom-author-box
Author box with color options and the ability to change the user to feature.

## Problem Statement 
The goal of this coding exercise is to create a WordPress plugin that leverages React, the WordPress Block API, and the REST API of your local development site to create a custom block that, when placed in the content of a post or page, will display a user profile box.
 
While the box should, by default, display the userâ€™s gravatar (via their email address), their display name, and their bio/description.
 

### TODO 
- Leverage [document..]
- - React
- - WordPress REST API
- - Local dev environment
create-block
Uses default theme styles (Meta/etc/schema?) - TwentyTwenty Two/Frostn markup
Editor view (default, change user)
Color changes (box background, text color)
Front-end view

Schema??
