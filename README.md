# Coding Challenge: WP Engine => Bio Box Beta 
Author box with color options.

## Problem Statement 
⬜️ The goal of this coding exercise is to create a WordPress plugin that leverages React, the WordPress Block API, and the REST API of your local development site to create a custom block that, when placed in the content of a post or page, will display a user profile box.
 
✅ While the box should, by default, display the user’s gravatar (via their email address), their display name, and their bio/description.
 
*****************
### Editor UI

✅ editor - render a representation of what the block content will look like in the front end view.

❌ The user should be able to choose the profile they want to display using a dropdown of the active accounts with a role of author, editor, or administrator. 

✅ The dropdown should be populated using the REST API.

✅ The user should be able to choose the box background and text color using the native color picker component.

❌ The user should be able to toggle on/off each of the default components: gravatar, display name, and bio/description.

************************
### Front-end UI

❌ The block content should display user information (gravatar, display name, bio) as specified in the Editor UI.

✅ The block content  should be rendered using the colors selected by the user in the Editor UI.

✅ Other styles should be inherited from the theme.
